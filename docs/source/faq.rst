Q: What is CHEESE? 

A: CHEESE is an open source platform for annotation and feedback.

Q: What makes CHEESE different from other annotation tools? 

A: CHEESE was designed for use in RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback).  
This means it can be used in online setups where the agent requires human feedback in real time. 
Additionally, we hope to use it to perform model assisted labelling, wherein an assisting model
assists a human in providing feedback for the main model.
