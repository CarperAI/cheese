# Contributing to CHEESE

Thank you for your interest in contributing to CHEESE! 

Before creating a PR for a non-trivial change, please first discuss the change you would like to make with other contributors of the repository. The easiest way to do this is by creating a github issue. We also have a channel dedicated to this project on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/canadagoose).

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

To submit a bug report or a feature request, please open an issue by clicking on the New Issue button and selecting the respective issue template. Make sure to fill out all the required information and provide as much detail as possible. For bug reports, this means including a minimal code example that reproduces the bug, and for feature requests, it means providing a clear and detailed description of the feature you would like to see implemented.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure requirements.txt is updated to reflect any new dependencies you may have added. If these dependencies were only added to a file in the `examples` directory, it is not necessary to add them to requirements.txt.
2. Sufficiently test your code for regressions by ensuring that all examples run without error and produce correct ouput.
3. Update the docs with any API or functionality changes.
4. You may merge your PR following approval of another contributor. If you do not have permission, you may request the reviewer to merge it for you.
