It waddled up to the counter and peered at the menu. There were all sorts of delicious-looking drinks, but the goose didn\\'t know what any of them were. It honked in frustration. The barista, a young woman with a kind face, came over. \\\"Can I help you?\\\" she asked. The goose honked again and pointed at the menu. The barista smiled. \\\"Let me guess, you want a cappuccino?\\\" The goose nodded eagerly. \\\"Coming right up!\\\" The barista got to work, and soon the goose had a steaming cup of cappuccino in front of it. It sipped cautiously at first, but then it started gulping it down. It was delicious! The goose finished its drink and waddled over to a cozy armchair by the window. It settled down with a contented sigh and watched the people go by outside. This was the life.\",\n",
